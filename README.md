## Project 2 - Speed run
> A road is subdivided into road segments of approximately the same length. Each road segment has a speed limit. 
In each move the car
can I) reduce its speed by one (brake), II) maintain the speed (cruise), or III) increase its speed by one (accelerate).
The car is placed at the first segment of the road with a speed of zero. It has to reach the last segment of the road
with a speed of one (at which point it can reduce the speed to zero and so, stop). The purpose of this assignment is
to determine the **minimum** number of moves required to reach the final position.</br>

> Tasks: </br>
> 1. Use a _time_limit_ of 3600.0 (one hour). This has to be done using
each one of the student numbers of the group as a (command line) input to the program. Record the execution
times as a function of the final position. Try to find a formula that gives a reasonably good estimate of the
execution time (as a function of the final position). For a final position of 800, estimate how long would the
program take to give an answer.
> 2. Invent other solution methods to reach a _final_position_ of 800. <br/>
> Consider solving the problem using dynamic programming (that will be explained later in this course).
> 3. Graphs of the execution time of the program as a function of the size of the problem.
